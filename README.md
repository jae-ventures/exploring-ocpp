# âš¡ EV Charging Station Management System

## Why This Project Exists

Ever wondered how all those EV charging stations talk to each other? Or how charging networks keep track of which stations are available? That's exactly what this project tackles! I built this system to demonstrate how modern EV charging infrastructure can be managed using industry standards and clean architecture.

## The EV Charging Challenge

The EV revolution is happening fast, but the infrastructure is still catching up. This project addresses real challenges I've observed:

- **"Is this station even working?"** - Remote monitoring to know station status in real-time
- **"Why can't all chargers speak the same language?"** - Implementation of OCPP for standardized communication
- **"How do we manage thousands of stations at once?"** - Scalable architecture for growing networks

## What's Under the Hood

- **.NET 9 Backend**: Because I believe in using modern tools for modern problems
- **OCPP Integration**: The industry-standard protocol that makes chargers play nice together
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets for instant updates when charging status changes
- **Interactive Simulator**: Test environment that behaves like real charging stations (without the electricity bill!)

## What The System Can Do

The API allows you to:
- Track charging station status and availability
- Remotely control charging sessions (start/stop)
- Monitor health metrics across your station network
- Simulate different charging scenarios

## How It's Built

I designed the architecture with scalability in mind:
- Clean separation between domain models, business logic, and API layers
- Asynchronous communication patterns for responsive performance
- Industry-standard protocols for maximum compatibility

## Where This Could Go

This is just the beginning! Future enhancements could include:
- Seamless payment processing (because charging shouldn't require five different apps)
- Cross-network roaming capabilities via OCPI
- Predictive analytics to anticipate charging demand
- User-friendly mobile interfaces for drivers

## Tech Stack

- .NET 9
- Entity Framework Core
- WebSockets
- OCPP Protocol
- Swagger/OpenAPI

## Why I Built This

As someone fascinated by the EV revolution, I wanted to demonstrate not just coding skills, but a deeper understanding of the infrastructure challenges the industry faces. This project showcases my ability to build systems that bridge the gap between technical standards and practical solutions in the rapidly evolving EV ecosystem.
